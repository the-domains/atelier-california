# Birth of Venus

A**lessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, known asSandro Botticelli(**

**Italian: **

**[\[ˈsandro bottiˈtʃɛlli\]][0]; c. 1445[\[1\]][1]-- May 17, 1510), was an[Italian painter][2]of the Early[Renaissance][3]. He belonged to the[Florentine School][4]under the patronage of[Lorenzo de' Medici][5], a movement that[Giorgio Vasari][6]would characterize less than a hundred years later in hisVitaof Botticelli as a "[golden age][7]". Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then, his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting.**

**Among Botticelli's best-known works are_[The Birth of Venus][8]_and_[Primavera][9]_.**
